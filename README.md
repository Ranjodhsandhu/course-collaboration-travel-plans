A simple app to keep track of destinations I'd like to visit.

# Learning to write markdown

To write in **bold** use ** before and after.

To _italicize_ the text use _ before and after the word.

To write the `code` snippet use backticks.

# for h1 use `#`
## for h2 use `##`
### for h3 use `###` and so on..
